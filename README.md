I didn't realize how much exif data Spotlight already indexes. Given this I don't think this utlity is really needed.

# exif2spotlight
Read exif metadata from images with exiftool and write to MacOS Spotlight searchable extended attributes

# Usage
exif2spotlight [--map/-m EXIF1,EXIF2... ATTR1,ATTR2] FILE1...
